# Traffic Violation Detection System

This project detects traffic violations using a YOLOv8 deep learning model.
Bounding boxes are drawn only around vehicles involved in violations such as
helmet violation and triple riding.

## Features

- Vehicle–violation association using IoU
- Streamlit web interface
- Cloud deployment ready

## Tech Stack
- Python
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- Streamlit
- OpenCV

## Deployment
Deployed using Streamlit Cloud.
